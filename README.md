## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Snake is a mini video game in which the player controls a snake that grows as it eats apples. 

It was in 1976 that the game of the snake appeared for the first time and was then only available on arcade under the name Blockhade.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The snake moves forward and its head must not touch the walls as well as its own body.

To play you must use the 'up', 'down', 'right' and 'left' arrows and the space key to restart the game.
